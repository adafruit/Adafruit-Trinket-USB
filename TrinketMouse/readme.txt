TrinketMouse is a part of Adafruit's Trinket/Gemma USB HID Arduino Library

TrinketMouse allows the user to implement a simple USB mouse inside the Arduino environment

Please see TrinketMouse.h for usage documentation, an example is also included

TrinketMouse uses V-USB (http://www.obdev.at/products/vusb/) to implement USB with a bitbang technique. See the folder "usbdrv" for V-USB files.

Adafruit's Trinket and Gemma can do almost anything that V-USB can do, including USB mouse, keyboards, joysticks, gamepads, MIDI devices, and much more (including custom devices that do not fit any existing category).
